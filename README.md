# ThirdScripted
-   This is a intelligence program library which is a temporally trial version.
-   All the methods are programmed as scripted code.
-   You could feel free to use, deliver and modify all the open source as you like.
-   I wish you could star this project and maybe contribute codes for it.

Dependences
-   Eigen, a C++ Linear Algrebra Library.
-   C++ STL.
